# Last-Robot-Direction-viewer
This repository for second task in the "Web Programming" track. The main idea of this second task is to track the robot location by identify the last direction the robot went to. To do this task, I prefer to design the last robot direction viewer using "Java Swing" and link it to the "MySql" database. By accessing the database of directions, we can identify the last direction of the robot from any place in case of the robot stuck in somewhere, so we can find the robot.

#Note: I separate this task from the first task and I did every task on different projects just to make every project in different repository.
